### Learnings from the project

 This are point That I have covered while creatine calculator.
1) Create a class with two number as argument.
2) Create multiple function which perform unique operation concept related to mathematics.
3) And Define all this above fuction in one single class using operator Overloading.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 As the project name suggest was to make calculator using Complex number. So first task was to define function as "complex number" to add number which perform complex number addition and second initilize two number one as real number & imaginary number. Then define mathematical concept function in coding form and perform math function uisng "complex number" function.
